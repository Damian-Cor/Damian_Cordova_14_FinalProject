# **Overview**

This project aims to find the predicted trend of the U.S Federal debt for the next decade (10 years) by using the debt statistics from 2000 to 2023. This data was fit into a 2nd degree polynomial, which was used to help predicted the future points.

## **Team**

Damian (Me - Seat #14) - I performed a lot of the importation of the data, indexing the table, and extracting only the variables we needed (Years/Debt). I wasn't able to get the readtable function to work, so I resorted to copying and pasting the statistics into my own table, in which I rounded all of the numbers to the nearest tenth for clarity. From there, I vizualized the data, and passed it on to Eason to calculate the trend. I also assisted in helping calculating the results using fix functions and a logical array.

Eason (Seat #13) - Eason created the script to create a fit curve with a polynomial to the 2nd degree. He used this curve created to find the predicted trend for the next decade. Finally, he gave a rough vizualization of the data with a plot.

Justing (Seat #16) - Justin was able to improve on the vizualization of the results, adding labels to the axis' and the title, as well as providing a legend. He then worked with Damian (Me) to calcualte the accuracy of the curve fit and the original data by rounding the data to integers, and matching them with a margin of error of 1.

## **Presentation**

Damian (Me) conducted some research on the topic, presenting the motivation for the topic, the issues surrounding the topic, and presenting the vizualization of the original data. Eason presented the code and the process of creating and calculating the predictions, as well as presenting a vizualization of the results. 
Justin presented the reults, explaining what it means in a global context, and presenting factors that could've affected the data. All 3 of us presented the conclusion, giving our final takeaways or thoughts on the project process,
MATLAB, and the course as a whole.

### **Side Note**

The code might have to run twice to project the results that we used. This is because of an oversight, not assigning a starting point to the curve fit. Apologise for the miss convenience.
